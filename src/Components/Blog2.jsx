        How do I start toilet training for my toddler?
      </h3>
      <p>
        When your child starts telling you their diaper is wet and needs to be
        removed,it's time to start potty training.Also you can start as early as
        when a child shows some understanding about toilet matters.It can happen
        between 18 months and three years.
      </p>
      <p id="par-b">
        Start toilet training when your toddler is showing signs of being ready
        and not because you as a parent feel the pressure or are being pressured
        by others to start toilet training too early for your child.

        Toilet training process.
      </h3>
      <p id="parr-b">
        1. Choose either a potty or a special toilet seat attachment.
      </p>
      <p id="parr-b">
        2. Make sure your child is wearing clothing that is easy to get off and
        on.
      </p>
      <p id="parr-b">
        3. Watch for signs that your toddler is about to pee or poo and guide
        him/her to the potty or toilet.
      </p>
      <p id="parr-b">
        4. Praise the times he/she makes it on time and praise the attempts that
        don't make it.Also you can reward them for motivation.
      </p>
      <p id="parr-b">
        5. Expect accidents, tell them it's okay even if you feel disappointed
        or frustrated.Change and clean them and let them know they can try it
        again.
      </p>
      <p id="parr-b">
        6. When your child doesn't seem like he/she is willing to try,leave it
        for a while and try starting again in a few days or a week.Punishment
        does not help with toilet training.

        Top Tip.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Leave a potty where a child can see and explain what it's for.Children
        learn by watching and copying.You can show him/her videos of other
        children using them.
